  The Sundew Algorithm is a bio-inspired, event-driven AI framework designed
  for resource-constrained systems. Inspired by the sundew plantâ€™s selective
  activation strategy, it introduces adaptive thresholds, energy-aware gating,
  and lightweight significance evaluation to achieve efficient, selective
  processing. This repository provides code, benchmarks, and analysis tools.
